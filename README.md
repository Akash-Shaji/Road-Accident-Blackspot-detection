# Road-Accident-Blackspot-detection
The EDA folder contains 3 jupyter notebooks
- eda2.ipnyb: This notebook contains heatmaps showing the most accident prone months, day of week, time slot
- Other 2 notebooks show the logistic regression model under different cases (when the accident data points are fed into the model after DBSCAN clustering or without clustering)
